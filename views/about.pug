          //- Replace the boilerplate below with your best elevator pitch
          p I am a former high school physics teacher, English teacher, and human resources manager who is ready to dive into the world of front-end development.  After taking a coding boot camp, I realized how interesting and enjoyable web development is.  I continue to learn and am currently expanding my skill set to include back-end development.  Writing clean code and putting all the pieces together to create a working application or web page is extremely satisfying.  My ultimate goal is to be a full-stack web developer capable of creating practical, but aesthetically pleasing projects.
